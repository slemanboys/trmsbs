# Privacy Policy

When Crowd Bypass (Options > "Give and take the destinations of unbypassable shorteners.") is enabled, a request to my server is being sent for it to work, of which I store nothing.

I use Clouflare and [their privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) applies to you as an "End User."
